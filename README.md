**PROJECT OVERVIEW:**
 - The project leverages Nike’s short-form video data to understand the drivers of viral trends across platforms such as TikTok and YouTube Shorts.
 - By using features including platform, content category, video duration, completion rate, engagement velocity, upload timing, and emoji usage, the model captures both creative and behavioral signals influencing virality.
 - This classification approach enables Nike to move from reactive trend analysis to proactive, data-driven viral content planning.
